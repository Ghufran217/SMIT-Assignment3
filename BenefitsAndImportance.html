    <h1>BENEFITS OF GOING TO THE GYM:</h1> <hr>
    <p>Many reasons to go to gym. Of course exercise is priority.
       The gym has plenty exercise machines that people can use to
       develop different muscle groups. Kulas in her article,
        “The Advantages of Going to the Gym Every Day”, 
        says at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise should be done
        by adults five days in a week so going to the gym everyday
        will meet that goal. It will result in good physical and
        mental health.

        Aside from exercising, one can meet new friends like fitness
        instructors and others. Its good to be with people with the
        same interests so that all can motivate each other to keep
        their fitness goals.
        
        When one exercises, the heart becomes stronger so it is
        efficient in pumping blood to the body so vital organs are
        kept healthy and in order. For example, blood pressure is
        maintained instead of spike high, cholesterol and
        triglyceride levels are kept low and heart disease is kept
        at bay. It means there is less chances of having a 
        heart attack or stroke or any other diseases when one 
        exercises regularly.</p> <hr><br>
    <h1>WHY GYM IS IMPORTANT:</h1><hr>
    <p>Combining aerobic exercise with other kinds of exercises like
        strength training with weights and stretching keeps muscles,
        ligaments, joints and tendons healthy, flexible and strong 
        so when one becomes older, he is stronger and have less risk 
        of being out of balance and falling causing fractures or
        other injuries. One also gets good posture when muscles are
        well-formed. That is why the person should select right 
        exercises for each muscle group.
     
        If one does not like to work with exercise machines, but still
        likes to exercise, gyms also offer group exercises which 
        includes boot camp exercises they do in teams, cycling 
        sessions on stationary bicycles, martial arts exercises like
        body combat, boxing, etc. and plenty of dance routines like 
        Zumba, HipHop, Ballroom Dancing, etc. It can be very fun and
        meet new people so social life becomes alive.
             
        One sleeps better also when the body gets good exercise. When 
        one sleeps well, he wake up with more energy to face the day
        and go about his work better in high spirits. Mood becomes
        better too so he is not grouchy to others. As one loses
        weight from exercising regularly and having a good balanced
        diet, one looks more fit and attractive so good body
        deserves good clothes that fit well</p><hr>
